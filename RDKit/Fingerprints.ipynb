Similarity, often known as the Jaccard Similarity, is a measure used to compare the similarity and diversity of sample sets. In cheminformatics, it's frequently applied to compare molecular fingerprints, which are binary vectors signifying the presence or absence of particular molecular attributes. It's important to point that the relationship between molecular descriptors and biological activity isn't always linear, and the degree of similarity required for consistent behavior depends on the specific activity. Also, the inherent properties of binary molecular representations might have a big effect on similarity outcomes. For instance, amall structural alterations can cause notable shifts in molecular properties and receptor perception.<sup>[8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/B409813G)</sup>\n","\n","The Tanimoto Similarity $T$ between two sets $A$ and $B$ (or two binary vectors) is given by:\n","\n","\n","$$T(A,B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$$\n","\n","\n","When applied to binary molecular fingerprints, this can be translated as:\n","\n","$$T(f_1, f_2) = \\frac{\\text{number of bits set in both } f_1 \\text{ and } f_2}{\\text{number of bits set in either } f_1 \\text{ or } f_2}$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $f_1$ and $f_2$ are two binary molecular fingerprints.\n","- The numerator counts the bits that are set (i.e., equal to 1) in both fingerprints.\n","- The denominator counts the bits that are set in either of the two fingerprints.\n","\n","Tanimoto Similarity values span between 0 and 1:\n","- A value of 1 indicates the two fingerprints are identical.\n","- A value of 0 means the two fingerprints share no common bits.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"kcGbuOoBx3Pq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('first_molecule', list(fp.GetOnBits()))\n","print('second_molecule', list(fp2.GetOnBits()))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Uq61E_zdyHtN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697446430760,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Stefani","userId":"12814809116010041758"}},"outputId":"d13d47b1-f0c6-45fc-9cd9-b6ff5fada0fd"},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["first_molecule [80, 106, 114, 244, 803, 1109, 1130, 1683]\n","second_molecule [114, 392, 803, 1039, 1057, 1683]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["DataStructs.TanimotoSimilarity(fp, fp2)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5MOKjH1ZymDi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697446430760,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Stefani","userId":"12814809116010041758"}},"outputId":"da479076-9709-410d-9535-a7c2b8a021e2"},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.2727272727272727"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":38}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["DataStructs.FingerprintSimilarity(fp,fp2) # = TanimotoSimilarity"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JbBbGeCuv-R2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697446430760,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Stefani","userId":"12814809116010041758"}},"outputId":"fbe43b1e-d309-48ff-82e3-002a32c3712d"},"execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.2727272727272727"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":39}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["However, `FingerprintSimilarity` function can compute different types of similarity coefficients depending on an optional third argument (e.g., Dice, Cosine, etc.).
