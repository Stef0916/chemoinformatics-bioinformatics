# Chemoinformatics - Bioinformatics Projects Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for all my chemoinformatics - bioinformatics projects. Each project has its own dedicated folder, where you can find more detailed information, code, datasets, and documentation specific to that project.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects available in this repository:

1. [Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) Modelling of human acetylcholinesterase inhibitors](): This project focuses on the analysis of potential inhibitors for Acetylcholinesterase, a key enzyme involved in Alzheimer's disease. The analysis puts together data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model evaluation, with a particular emphasis on the Random Forest algorithm.
